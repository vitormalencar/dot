## Style Guide

Look at how the code is being maintained, we must always be consistent. We try to follow best practices as much as possible. In addition, here are some tips you should follow:

**For JavaScript:**

- No semicolons.
- No unused variables.
- Use tab for indentation.
- Use `===` instead of `==`.
- Use single quotes for strings except to avoid escaping.
- Add a space after keywords.
- Add a space before a function declaration's parentheses.
- Infix operators must be spaced.
- Commas should have a space after them.
- Keep else statements on the same line as their curly braces.
- For multi-line if statements, use curly braces.
- Always handle the `err` function parameter.
- Always prefix browser globals with `window.`.
- Multiple blank lines not allowed.
- For the ternary operator in a multi-line setting, place `?` and `:` on their own lines.
- For var declarations, write each declaration in its own statement.
- Wrap conditional assignments with additional parentheses. This makes it clear that the expression is intentionally an assignment (`=`) rather than a typo for equality (`===`).

**For Stylesheet:**

- Properties and selectors are sorted in alphabetical order
- Always use tab to indentation, no spaces
- Always use single quote, i.e. `content: ''`
- Quote attribute values in se
